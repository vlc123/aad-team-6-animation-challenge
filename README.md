The app is just a simple diary app, where one can record his/her life as it was done with the traditional diary.
Typically, a person launches the app and is presented with a list of previous enteries.
He as the option of clicking on one to view and edit or adding a new one.
We need to enforce authentication of some sort to enable that not anyone can access the app.
